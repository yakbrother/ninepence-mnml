    <h1>thank you</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
      Thanks for subscribing to my newsletter! I'm excited to share stories, thoughts on accessibility, life in Switzerland, and whatever else is on my mind with you.

    <div class="confirmation-box">
      <h2>Check your inbox</h2>
      <p>
        I've sent you a confirmation email. Please click the link in that email to confirm your subscription. This helps ensure you actually want to hear from me and keeps the spam bots away.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your spam folder. Sometimes these confirmation emails get filtered there.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      Once you confirm, you'll start receiving occasional updates from me. No spam, just genuine thoughts and stories. You can unsubscribe anytime if you change your mind.
