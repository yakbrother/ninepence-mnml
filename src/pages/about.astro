      <p>
        My name is Tim Eaton, but all my friends call me Virgil. It's nice to
        have a real name that I chose, one that I always dreamt I was called. I
        stick with Tim for work and legal reasons, but Virgil is way more
        fun.

        A few things to know about me: I was raised extremely right-wing, and
        while I still have some of that libertarian knee-jerk attitude, I've
        moved far to the left over the time and will happily stand up for the
        rights of all people (<em>yes, even you, Fred, damn you</em>). Most of
        my life I spent with vaguely anarchist tendencies, but I found a home in
        Switzerland, and I'm enjoying the socialism that makes it easy to live a
        free and happy life in the middle class, where my taxes help the country
        instead of being spent on endless war.

        I have been a writer and a programmer for most of my life, but I've had
        many jobs, from volunteer fireman to disaster relief, barista to chef,
        street musician to animal caretaker, day laborer to director to teacher
        - all around the world. During this time I've met many people and
        gathered many stories to tell.

        As for the rest, you'll discover that over time. I can't ever say no to
        an adventure, but recently events have been keeping me in a wheelchair,
        so I'm going to sit and write about people and happenstances. Please
        enjoy!

      <h3>A note on AI:</h3>
      <p>
        I never use AI to write, but I have found one prompt that I find very
        engaging and will continue to use.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <em>
          Acting as an editor, are you engaged by this story? Are there any
          confusing parts? If so, please explain.</em
        >
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The response is great, like notes from an editor. I find this to be
        ethical, because I use the notes (or ignore them) to rewrite entirely in
        my own words. I never use it to change or generate content.

      <h3>Colophon:</h3>
      <p>
        I designed this site myself to be fluid and easy on the eyes, using <a
          href="https://astro.build">Astro</a
        > as the engine and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> for hosting.
        The main fonts are Vorkall for readability and Rustic Printed for the header.
        I have an <a href="/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> if you'd rather view it in your
        own preferred program.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you or anyone you know need design or programming help, I charge on a
        sliding scale - anything from cups of coffee and a <em
          >pain au chocolat</em
        > for bit of help, to hard Euros for corporate work. You can find my freelancer
        site at <a href="https://timeaton.dev">timeaton.dev</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm more than happy to answer any questions you might have about
        building your own Astro site!
