When I'm holding my ukulele, I forget about the wheelchair. When I can sing loud, in an echoing barn, and people are dancing to my music, I forget the pain. I forget nearly everything except my hands, my voice, and the sounds of stomping and laughter. Between songs, an iced panaché kept my voice from going dry. _This is life. I'm creating a barn dance that kids and adults enjoy. My mind is here and my voice is here and my fingers can't stop playing._

It's a nice instrument - a tenor carbon fibre ukulele with a bold sound. It's nice for my blend of folk punk and protest songs, and the carbon fibre means it doesn't warp or change shape when I travel in the humidity.

And that's what I'm doing. Traveling. For the first time since the hospital, in years. It gives me the same hope the music does. I had some paperwork in Reims, France, and then we headed to the north to stay at an old family farmhouse. The food was excellent and we ended each night by dancing with friends and family.

I've always carried an instrument when I travel - a mandolin, harmonicas, a banjo, an accordion… it combines my favorite things, especially with Julie by my side. And this time was no exception.

France always makes me feel alive and at home. After I wrote about <a href="/stories/prenez-ma-place-prenez-mon-handicap/">Switzerland</a>, the people on the French train were a breath of fresh air. Everywhere I went, people were happy to get out of their seats and help me. Even taking a bus through Paris was surprisingly pleasant - I wasn't the only wheelchair user and everyone was kind to both of us.

I wondered what this was about to Julie's uncle. He said that perhaps the Swiss think it's more polite to not notice, while the French have a stronger sense of community and care.

And Paris, which I haven't seen in more than a year… The diversity in Paris is like nothing else. Foreign languages everywhere, all social classes represented. The air was filled with food and music and conversations. I always feel a swelling in my heart when I get back to Paris.

But back to the music. After a meal and good wine, everyone wanted to dance. I went through a lot of the old songs I used to play…. Carter Family songs, Bella Ciao, Railroad Earth, and a few originals. I added some new songs I've been working on, bringing old Johnny Preston into my repertoire. As each song ended, one kid kept saying “encore une!”

We laughed and sang and danced till midnight, and I went to bed feeling alive and happy. No disability was going to beat this out of me.

_There is sunshine in our shadows,_
_There is sunshine when it rains._
_There is sunshine in our sorrows,_
_And our hearts are filled with pain…_
