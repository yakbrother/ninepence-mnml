So… thanks to the [kindness of friends and strangers](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-get-a-used-wheelchair?utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&utm_medium=customer&utm_source=copy_link&attribution_id=sl:ebfd96d6-e903-47d8-ae8a-7b5c903b56bf), I raised enough to buy myself a wheelchair. Someday I hope insurance in some country will kick in and I’ll have one custom made, but who knows how long that will take. For now, it is time to build my own.

First, I found a wheelchair in Zurich. Julie and I zipped up there for the weekend, grabbed an Ottobock adjustable lightweight chair, quite a nice deal for a good brand in fact. It was smaller than my hospital chair, but still not road-ready. For that, I needed a lower back, better footrests, an axle to counter the wobbly folding assembly (because physics), the right center of gravity, and perhaps new wheels. Extra money donated will go towards parts and accessibility in our house.

I think it has potential. I’ve picked up some tools and accessories along the way, and with my bike-building experience, I just need to find the parts and put it together.

Here’s a quick video of the chair and what I want to do with it:
